        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Fettucine noodles are my favorite noodle to make on Earth. It is mouthwatering goodness, and I cannot
            seem to ever resist the urge when it arises! Here is the recipe I follow, I hope you enjoy it as much 
            as I do. This recipe can be scaled up/down, just add/subtract 100 grams of 00 flour per 1 egg. The recipe 
            laid out for you today is good for about 2-3 people.
        </p>
        <p>In order to prepare Fettucine, you must first source the best ingredients.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>00 Flour</li>
            <li>Farm Fresh Eggs</li>
            <li>A bit of water</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and last but not least, <strong><em>ELBOW GREASE</em></strong>!</p>
        <h4>Step by step!</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start out by setting 2 eggs out till they hit room temp. This is <strong>very </strong>important.</li>
            <li>Once that is done, make a mound out of 200 grams of flour, then form a volcano.</li>
            <li>Beat both eggs in, whilst slowing bringing in flour from the sides.</li>
            <li>Add a pinch of salt, and continue to whisk in flour. Once you have achieved a sort of dough, start to knead it together.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 10-15 minutes and continue to add water when necessary. When done, cover dough with plastic wrap and place inside refridgerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it! Now all that is left to do, is roll out the dough, as thin as you can, 
            then cut the noodles or use a pasta making machine. Hang to dry. Freeze or 
            put in boiling pot of heavily salted water for 90-120 seconds. Fresh pasta cooks quick!
