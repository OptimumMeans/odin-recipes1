        <p>In order to prepare Fettucine, you must first source the best ingredients.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>00 Flour</li>
            <li>Farm Fresh Eggs</li>
            <li>A bit of water</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ol>
        <p>and last but not least, <strong><em>ELBOW GREASE</em></strong>!</p>
        <p>Start out by 2 setting eggs out till they hit room temp. This is <strong>very </strong>important.
        Once that is done, make a mound out of 200 grams of flour, then form a volcano. Beat both eggs in, whilst
    slowing bringing in flour from the sides. Add a pinch of salt, and continue to whisk in flour. Once you have 
achieved a sort of dough, start to knead it together. Knead for about 10-15 minutes and continue to add water 
when necessary. When done, cover dough with plastic wrap and place inside refridgerator for 30 minutes. </p>
